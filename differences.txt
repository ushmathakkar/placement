DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR EACH & MAP:-

forEach()?—?executes a provided function once for each array element.
map()?—?creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
What exactly does this mean?

Well, the forEach() method doesn’t actually return anything (undefined). It simply calls a provided function on each element in your array. This callback is allowed to mutate the calling array.

Meanwhile, the map() method will also call a provided function on every element in the array. The difference is that map() utilizes return values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.
